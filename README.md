# RESTMoon

ü¶Ä A lightweight HTTP proxy written in Rust that analyzes REST API traffic and provides real-time performance metrics.

## Features

- **Raw TCP/HTTP Implementation**: Built from scratch without heavy HTTP frameworks
- **Flexible Routing**: Support for both environment-based and header-based destination routing
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, maximum performance

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathieura/restmoon
cd restmoon
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage

#### Option 1: Fixed Destination (Environment Variable)
```bash
export DESTINATION="localhost:8080" # Optional
export PROXY_PORT="8081"  # Optional, defaults to 8081
cargo run
```

#### Option 2: Dynamic Destination (Headers)
```bash
cargo run

# Then make requests with destination header:
curl -H "X-Proxy-Destination: api.example.com:80" http://localhost:8081/api/users
```

### Example Output

```
üöÄ Proxy Analyzer starting (Raw TCP/HTTP)...
   Listening on: 127.0.0.1:8081
   Default destination: localhost:8080

üìä Request Analytics:
----------------------------------------
[14:32:15] GET /rest/v0/vms -> localhost:8080 (245.30ms) [200 OK]
[14:32:16] POST /rest/v0/vm/start -> localhost:8080 (1250.45ms) [200 OK]  
[14:32:18] GET /rest/v0/hosts -> localhost:8080 (89.12ms) [200 OK]
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DESTINATION` | Default target server (host:port) | None |
| `PROXY_PORT` | Port for the proxy to listen on | 8081 |

### Header-based Routing

For dynamic routing, include the destination in your request headers:

```http
GET /api/endpoint HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8081
X-Proxy-Destination: backend.example.com:8080
```

The proxy will:
1. Check for `X-Proxy-Destination` header first
2. Fall back to `DESTINATION` environment variable
3. Return 500 error if neither is provided

## Use Cases

- **API Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and identify slow endpoints
- **Development Debugging**: Monitor API calls during frontend development
- **Load Testing Analysis**: Observe API behavior under different loads
- **Microservices Debugging**: Route and analyze traffic between services

## Architecture

```
Client ‚Üí [Proxy Analyzer :8081] ‚Üí Target API Server
                ‚Üì
         Real-time Metrics
```

The proxy:
1. Accepts incoming TCP connections
2. Parses HTTP requests manually  
3. Forwards requests to the target server
4. Measures response times and logs analytics
5. Returns responses to the client
